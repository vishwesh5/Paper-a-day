    "\n",
    "If we refer to another paper (**Context Based Object Categorization: A Critical Survey**), Contextual Features are used to represent the interaction of an object with its surroundings. It can be divided into the following 3 categories:\n",
    "1. **Semantic Context** - This focuses on object co-occurence and allows to correct label of one object without affecting the label of other objects. For example, a tree is more likely to co-occur with a plant than a whale.\n",
    "2. **Spatial Context** - This focuses on the position of objects. For example, a dog is more likely to be present above grass and below sky rater than above sky and below grass. \n",
    "3. **Scale Context** - This focuses on relative size of objects. For example, a car is relatively smaller than a truck and not the other way round.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font style = \"color:rgb(8,133,37)\">Approach</font>\n",
    "The approach discussed in the paper consists of the following 3 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coarse Soft Segmentation** - This involves dividing the contextual pixels (surrounding pixels) into soft object regions. The word \"soft\" here means that our focus is NOT on carrying out accurate segmentation.\n",
    "2. **Object Region Representation** - We use the soft segmentation obtained from the above step and the pixel representation to represent each object region.\n",
    "3. **Object-Contextual Representation** (OCR) - We use the output from the above 2 steps along with Pixel-Region relation to obtain the augmented representations.\n",

    "### <font style = \"color:rgb(8,133,37)\">Differences</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "**OCR vs Multi-Scale Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. OCR differentiates contextual pixels which belong to the same class to the contextual pixels which belong to different class.\n",
    "2. Multi-Scale Context approach only differentiates pixels present at different positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**OCR vs other Relational Context schemes**\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach discussed in the paper considers not only the object region representations but also the pixel and pixel-region relations, unlike other approaches."
